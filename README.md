# Title 
DH100 Project - Analyzing zillow rental data across the United States.

# Description and Purpose

In this project I plan to use rental data from zillow, along withincome data from Data Planet, to analyze the following:
1) What determines rental price?
2) What is the general trend for housing prices by location -- what caused outlying situations? 
3) 3) How does housing price overtime in comparison with minimum wage, median income, and other financial indicators in the United States

# Goals
1) Represent data by location through GeoPandas to plot out affordability
2) Use WebScraping to gather data from Zillow
3) Gather enough data to make predictions/estimates on rental price growth, and what determines rental price.
