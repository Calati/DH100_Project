# Title 
DH100 Project - Analyzing Housing Data across Alameda County.

# Description and Purpose

In this project I plan to use rental data from zillow, along with income data from the US Census, to analyze the following:
1) What is the general trend for housing prices by location -- what caused outlying situations? 
2) How does housing price change overtime in comparison with median income
3) What are the demographic distributions in lower and higher income areas within Alameda County

# Goals
1) Represent data by location through GeoPandas to predict a trend in affordability
2) Use WebScraping to gather data from Zillow and the Census
